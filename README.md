# Singapore Population Pyramid

The purpose of this project is to investigate the changes in Singapore's population over the years and represent it visually through population pyramids (also called age-gender-pyramids). Population pyramids are used to represent Singapore's population data because it enables a graphical illustration that shows the distrubtion of the population in various age groups, which will take the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. In this project, we will use data of Singapore's population from 1960 to 2020 from the [Department of Statistics Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data).
