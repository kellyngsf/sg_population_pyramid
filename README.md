# Singapore Population Pyramid

The purpose of this project is to investigate the changes in Singapore's population over the years and represent it visually through population pyramids (also called age-gender-pyramids). Population pyramids are used to represent Singapore's population data because it enables a graphical illustration that shows the distrubtion of the population in various age groups, which will take the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. In this project, we will use data of Singapore's population from 1960 to 2020 from the [Department of Statistics Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data).

# Findings
A faceted population pyramid plot was made to show the changes in Singapore's population over the years from 1960 to 2020 (the plot is shown below). From this project, it was found that there is an increasing aging population in Singapore, which is shown through the wider growing bars near the top of the population pyramid. For the middle-aged group, there is a noticable bulge, especially from 1990 onwards, for example, in 2020, there are more Singaporeans aged from 65 to 90 than Singaporeans aged between 0 to 4. Finally, the younger population has slightly declined from 1960 till 1980. After that, the younger population has roughly remained the same. And regarding changes in the gender population, the population pyramids are slightly asymmetric because women tend to live longer than men.
